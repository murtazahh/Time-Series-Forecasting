# Time-Series-Forecasting
Time Series Forecasting: Use time series analysis and machine learning techniques to forecast future values of a given dataset.

This code uses the Prophet library to create a time series forecasting model. The fit method is used to train the model on the data, and the make_future_dataframe method is used to create a dataframe for future predictions. The predict method is then used to make the predictions, and the plot method is used to visualize the forecast.

The input data should contain two columns, one for the date, and another for the value that you want to predict. The date column should be named 'ds' and the value column should be named 'y' and in the format of a csv file.

Please note that this is a very simple example and it may not work well on your specific dataset. You may need to adjust the parameters of the model and also, you may need to perform some preprocessing and cleaning of the data before using it to train the model. The Prophet library is very robust and it's able to handle a lot of time series related challenges such as missing data, seasonality, and trend, but it's not suitable for all types of time series data, you can use other libraries such as ARIMA, LSTM, SARIMA and so on according to your data characteristics.

Also, keep in mind that time series forecasting can be a challenging task, and it's essential to evaluate the model performance using appropriate metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE and etc.
